## Video Prototype

In this video prototype for our cooking instructor, we are trying to emulate on how a teenager can easily search and cook a recipe without preexisting knowledge of recipes. She just needs to input what available ingredients she has in her disposal and the app can search what recipes she can cook now. While it didn't show an example where no recipe matched exactly(100%) on what she can use, the app can sort the recipes she can cook and add the missing ingredients on a grocery list that the app can generate. The ingredient list in this case are all colored green because she has it all available, if it was not, it will be colored red.

We also showed on how the app will look like when following the steps for the recipe as well as controlling it with voice commands. Apart from the normal step view which just include an image and the general step, We are also adding a more in-depth information on it by including a video showing how to do it and tips that she might find useful. 

## Storyboard

There has been 2 revision in the process of making the storyboard. The first one was on the very first photo on the left and middle pile of papers, the final one was the one on the right side. We have decided to start the video where the actress has just came from school and found to food to eat on the dining room and the fridge. She then pulls out her phone and opens our cooking instructor app. We initially thought of her going trhought the pantry and listing the seasoning and pasta since the dish we are planning to show was spaghetti and meatballs. Due to changing circumstance and opportunity, we have since changed the dish to be grilled patty with cheese. We then layed out the general interface lok and feel we are going to be showing in the video. We later on decided to include voice command to forward the steps as it has been suggested to us.

## Task-Centered System Walkthrough

Doing a task-centered walkthrough of our storyboard scenario didn't reveal as many issues as we initially thought. However, there were a couple of potential problems that we caught early on. First, it was unsure if the user would be knowledgable in knowing that "ingredient match" was what the user needed to choose for their current needs. We thought that this would most likely be helped by a tool-tip method to explain the choices. We also discovered that choices may be overwhelming with a "selection choice box" method, suggesting that a form search may be more practical. Finally, we've confirmed that more hyperlinks for explanations and sorting meals by preparation difficulty would help with the user's experience.

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram

Our brainstorming session was spread out over a couple of days - the above picture was taken as we were finishing examining the storyboards and affinity diagrams. Earlier in the week, we took a look at some ideas we had brainstormed in class and began to refine them. It was at this time we began our affinity diagrams for a scenario involving a teenager with no cooking experience using our "ingredient-matching" feature, which we believe to be an important part of our app design.
