# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Executive Summary

### Looking for an Untapped Market

For our project, we had originally planned to make an accessible cooking instructor for users who have very little experience. The intention was that our target users would use the app to increase their cooking knowledge and boost their confidence in attempting to cook new recipes. However, we discovered that currently there are not many products on the market targeted at pre-teenagers and young adults. For this reason, we have directed our application at the teenage-to-young-adult age bracket, with options available for other novice cooks. Our app was developed on a mobile platform since phones are the most prevalent device being used by our target age bracket.


## Introduction

This is our appplication, the Cooking Instructor. Our team consists of:

### Marc DeSorcy

Fourth year student at University of Calgary, Computer Science Major with a concentration in Game Design. In charge of research, design and functionality.

### Michael David Pascual

Fourth year student in University of Calgary taking a concentration in Information Security. Mainly in charge of Graphics & UI look and feel.


## Design Problem

### Designing For Younger and Kitchen illiterate audience

One of the things we needed to consider is how to teach our target audience about kitchen terms, unfamiliar ingredients and vague steps. Changing the vocabulary to make it easier for novices and making it consistent would be the main priority. Using different kind of mediums may help on explaining terms and step.

### Designing for different needs of our potential users

Targeting younger audiences means they may not be responsible for groceries. They also will need a lot more flexibility for their time availability. We will need to build tools to allow them to still learn with the restriction of only using the immediaite ingredients that are available for their use. We also need to consider what tools and equipment that they have in their kitchen.

### Recipes are still boring to look at

While recipes has made into in the interwebs, it still hasn’t changed a lot compared to cooking books. We want to make cooking engaging and as much fun as possible esepcially that our target audience would need more stimulation to keep their interest on the learning process.


## User Research and Findings

The first form of user research we performed was interviews with potential users. We asked several people a series of five questions, consisting of, “What could an electronic device provide you that a cookbook couldn't,” “What difficulties are you having when cooking meals,” “Would you try out an electronic cooking instructor,” “Are you more likely to try out cooking new things knowing that you have an electronic cooking instructor,” and “Are you willing to spend money for this kind of app?” Through these questions, we learned several important things we may have overlooked otherwise. For one, those interviewed believed a cooking instructor could provide a visual sense of how ingredients are added, put together, and assembled. They also desired features we hadn’t considered such as an in-app timer, vocalization of steps, and the ability to clarify concepts or steps. We learned that some users have concerns about adding the wrong ingredients or adding ingredients at the improper time. Interestingly, we learned younger users, like college students, are unlikely to be willing to pay a large amount for the app. Finally, a cooking instructor would likely make people more adventurous in cooking.

## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

After performing a heuristic analysis, we identified four main issues with the system. These include recipe matching not working if the timer is set to less than 10 hours, the possibility of the timer slider covering up the Hard difficulty setting if the timer is set to more than 10 hours, the lack of an obvious method to return to the previous screen if there’s no matching recipe, and the app overlooking utensils when showing recipes. We considered these issues to be of the same importance to fix as the order they were mentioned in, each having severity ratings of 4, 4, 3 and 2, respectively.

The most severe issue is how, during the main recipe-matching screen filter selection, if the total time is set to anything less than 10 hours, the search will to find any recipes whatsoever, regardless of other settings. This is a very serious Error Prevention issue, and can be solved simply by fixing this bug. Some in our group did not believe this was important as it was an issue with the prototyping system, but others believed that regardless of the cause, it cripples usage of the system.

Our second most severe issue is related to the first, as after doing a recipe search, if the user finds the filter tab, if the timer is set to over 10 hours, it covers up the check box for the “Hard” difficulty setting. This is another Error Prevention issue, and it could be solved by making the slider bar lower so that it can’t reach the check boxes for the difficulties. Alternatively, the slider could have a maximum value it could be set to. Finding the filter tab itself is also a discoverability issue, but it was not considered as serious as those we identified.

A less severe but still serious issue is the lack of easy escape when no matching recipes are discovered. In such a case, we’ve provided an error message consisting of an image of a sad chef saying “we didn’t match any recipes,” but there is no way to escape this screen other than pressing the back button on the phone itself. This method may not be obvious to the user, and is a violation of User Control and Freedom that can be corrected by adding an “emergency exit” in the form of a back or menu button.

Finally, the app always assumes that the user has the correct utensils and tools to cook any recipe, and will always label them in green in the ingredients list. This, of course, is not always true, and is believed to be both an Efficiency of Use and an Error Prevention issue. It could be solved by putting utensils and tools into the ingredient matching selection.
