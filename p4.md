# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Executive Summary

### Looking for an Untapped Market

For our project, we had originally planned to make an accessible cooking instructor for users who have very little experience. The intention was that our target users would use the app to increase their cooking knowledge and boost their confidence in attempting to cook new recipes. However, we discovered that currently there are not many products on the market targeted at pre-teenagers and young adults. For this reason, we have directed our application at the teenage-to-young-adult age bracket, with options available for other novice cooks. Our app was developed on a mobile platform since phones are the most prevalent device being used by our target age bracket.


## Introduction

This is our appication, the Cooking Instructor. Our team consists of:

### Marc DeSorcy

Fourth year student at University of Calgary, Computer Science Major with a concentration in Game Design. In charge of research, design and functionality.

### Michael David Pascual

Fourth year student in University of Calgary taking a concentration in Information Security. Mainly in charge of Graphics & UI look and feel.


## Design Problem

For our cooking instructor, we’ve considered potential problems and have narrowed our design problem down to focus on three issues.

### Designing For Younger and Kitchen illiterate audience

As we are designing for a very cooking-illiterate audience, one of the things we needed to consider is how to teach our target audience about kitchen terms, unfamiliar ingredients and vague steps. The main priority for this would be changing the vocabulary or using alternative, more familiar terms to make it easier for novices. Such changes would also need to be kept self-consistent. It would also help explaining different terms in the recipes and steps in the cooking process by using different mediums, such as images, animations, or videos.

### Designing for different needs of our potential users

Targeting younger audiences means they may not be responsible for groceries in their households, and they may also need a large degree of flexibility for how much time they can spend cooking. Therefore, our cooking instructor will need tools to allow our users to cook and learn recipes with the restriction of only using the immediate ingredients that are available for their use. At the same time, we also need to consider what tools and equipment that the users would have in their kitchen or household.

### Recipes are still boring to look at

While cooking recipes have appeared on the internet, they have not changed much in format compared to the cookbooks they developed from. We want to make cooking more engaging and entertaining for our target audience compared to existing online cooking recipes. This rings especially true since our target audience would need more stimulation to keep their interest on the learning process of cooking.


## User Research and Findings

### Interview

The first form of user research we performed was interviews with potential users. We asked several people a series of five questions, consisting of, “What could an electronic device provide you that a cookbook couldn't,” “What difficulties are you having when cooking meals,” “Would you try out an electronic cooking instructor,” “Are you more likely to try out cooking new things knowing that you have an electronic cooking instructor,” and “Are you willing to spend money for this kind of app?” Through these questions, we learned several important things we may have overlooked otherwise. For one, those interviewed believed a cooking instructor could provide a visual sense of how ingredients are added, put together, and assembled. They also desired features we hadn’t considered such as an in-app timer, vocalization of steps, and the ability to clarify concepts or steps. We learned that some users have concerns about adding the wrong ingredients or adding ingredients at the improper time. Interestingly, we learned younger users, like college students, are unlikely to be willing to pay a large amount for the app. Finally, a cooking instructor would likely make people more adventurous in cooking.

### Secondary Research

Secondary research was done to scout out what existing apps are being used in the market. We discovered that no popular cooking-related app for the pre-teen to young-adult markets exists, which is what led to us choosing them as our target audience. Also, most cooking apps we discovered are mainly focused on organizing and planning meals for the week. All of the similar apps that were found have a “grocery list” feature, and we have decided to include a similar feature in our app as it is likely a popular feature and not having it may make our instructor less appealing. Most other applications are not free, usually requiring a one-time fee or a subscription-based series of payments. Since our target audience don't have steady work or have limited income, we plan to release the cooking instructor for free or a very reasonable one-time fee. We also found out that other apps rarely use videos in their recipes, and the few apps that do would have a single video for the entire recipe process, rather than specific clips for vague steps or uncommon terms used in the recipe. They also don’t show alternative ingredients for the recipes that the user alright might have. Finally, virtually all of the other apps assume that the user already has at least a moderate understanding of cooking terminology, something that may not be true for our target audience.

## Design Flow and Justification

We have decided on 4 important features for the "ingredient matching" functionality in the prototype.

### Ingredient Matching

Our app’s main focus is on inexperienced cooks. A method of finding recipes based on the users’ ingredient supply is thus the first step. Ingredient matching allows the user to input all of their available ingredients at their disposal, and then let the app do the heavy lifting of matching recipes that the user would be able to cook based on their inputs.

### Verbatim Filtering

We want our application to be accessible by everyone with different level of experience. Therefore, we have implemented a “difficulty filtering” system to only show recipes that are easy, moderate, hard, or some combination of difficulty levels. We are also including time filters, which when used only show recipes that can be done within a specified time limit. This allows users to have a flexibility that they need to be able to learn how to cook in their busy life.

### Grocery List and Missing Ingredients

If the user wants to make a specific recipe, but they don't have all the ingredients required, a grocery list feature has been implemented to allow the user to quickly add missing ingredients. When selecting this feature, all missing ingredients in their selected recipe will be added to a grocery list, telling them what they need to buy next time.

### Hyperlink Sub-Steps

We are including underlined hyperlinks for the clarification of vague steps or uncommon terms or ingredients to allow our audience to quickly learn more about it. The sub-steps in hyper-links could be a pop-up clarification, a video demonstration for concepts or steps, or additional information for uncommon ingredients.
 
## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

After performing a heuristic analysis, we identified four main issues with the system. These include recipe matching not working if the timer is set to less than 10 hours, the possibility of the timer slider covering up the Hard difficulty setting if the timer is set to more than 10 hours, the lack of an obvious method to return to the previous screen if there’s no matching recipe, and the app overlooking utensils when showing recipes. We considered these issues to be of the same importance to fix as the order they were mentioned in, each having severity ratings of 4, 4, 3 and 2, respectively.

The most severe issue is how, during the main recipe-matching screen filter selection, if the total time is set to anything less than 10 hours, the search will to find any recipes whatsoever, regardless of other settings. This is a very serious Error Prevention issue, and can be solved simply by fixing this bug. Some in our group did not believe this was important as it was an issue with the prototyping system, but others believed that regardless of the cause, it cripples usage of the system.

Our second most severe issue is related to the first, as after doing a recipe search, if the user finds the filter tab, if the timer is set to over 10 hours, it covers up the check box for the “Hard” difficulty setting. This is another Error Prevention issue, and it could be solved by making the slider bar lower so that it can’t reach the check boxes for the difficulties. Alternatively, the slider could have a maximum value it could be set to. Finding the filter tab itself is also a discoverability issue, but it was not considered as serious as those we identified.

A less severe but still serious issue is the lack of easy escape when no matching recipes are discovered. In such a case, we’ve provided an error message consisting of an image of a sad chef saying “we didn’t match any recipes,” but there is no way to escape this screen other than pressing the back button on the phone itself. This method may not be obvious to the user, and is a violation of User Control and Freedom that can be corrected by adding an “emergency exit” in the form of a back or menu button.

Finally, the app always assumes that the user has the correct utensils and tools to cook any recipe, and will always label them in green in the ingredients list. This, of course, is not always true, and is believed to be both an Efficiency of Use and an Error Prevention issue. It could be solved by putting utensils and tools into the ingredient matching selection.


## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design

For our next iteration, we would focus first on fixing existing bugs and critical search options in Axure, our prototyping system. This includes correcting heuristic problems, mainly the timer issues, and implementing utensil matching and ingredient quantity. Secondly, we would want to implement other search features such as by recipe or ingredient name. This would be accommodation for more knowledgeable users that might not need our current recipe-match functionality, as they would know the names of ingredients and equipment needed. Next, we would like to implement a touch-free step-by-step recipe viewer. Such a system would have voice-overs listing recipe ingredients, tools and steps, and could traverse through steps using voice commands from the user. This would allow the user to put their phone or tablet in one spot, where all they would need to do is glance at it from time to time and use the voice-control to move on. Finally before shipping, we would add “gamification” features to keep our younger audiences engaged in the continuous usage of the cooking instructor. These features would include things like achievements, everyday goals, levels and experience, perks, coupons, and social features.
