## User wants to see all matching recipes that he can make with his available ingredients

If the user wants to find all matching recipes with his available ingredients. He would need to click "Ingredient Match". From there, he would neeed to input all the ingredients in his disposal and click find recipes and choose the appopriate filters that he would want. [TODO: INPUT MORE]

## User wants to cook something quick

If the user wants to find a recipe that is easy to make, he will do the same step as the previous one up to the selection of the filters ih the ingredient selector. Instead he needs to drag the timer slider down to match his available time to cook

## Heuristic Evaluation Results

The four main issues we identified during our heuristic analysis are recipe matching not working if the timer is set to less than 10 hours, the possibility of the timer slider covering up the Hard difficulty setting, the lack of an obvious method to return to the previous screen if there’s no matching recipe, and the app overlooking utensils when showing recipes. We consider these issues to be of the same importance to fix as the order they were mentioned in, each having severity ratings of 4, 4, 3 and 2, respectively.
The most severe issue is how, during the main recipe-matching screen filter selection, if the total time is set to anything less than 10 hours, the search will to find any recipes whatsoever, regardless of other settings. This is a very serious Error Prevention issue, and can be solved simply by fixing this bug. One of our group members didn’t believe this was important as it was an issue with Axure, but others believe that regardless of the cause, it cripples usage of the system.
Second on the list is a related issue. After doing a recipe search, if the user finds the filter tab (finding said tab itself is also an issue, although not as serious as those identified), if the timer is set to over 10 hours, it covers up the check box for the “Hard” difficulty setting. This is another Error Prevention issue, and it could be solved by making the slider bar lower so that it can’t reach the check boxes for the difficulties. Alternatively, there could be a maximum time set to the slider.
A less severe but still serious issue involves the issue of when no matching recipes are discovered. We see an image of a sad chef saying we didn’t match any recipes, but there is no way to escape this screen other than pressing the back button on the phone itself, which may not be obvious to the viewer. This is a violation of User Control and Freedom, and can be solved by adding an “emergency exit” in the form of a back or menu button.
Finally, the app always assumes that the user has the correct utensils and/or tools to create the dish, and will always label them in green in the ingredients list. This, of course, is not always true, and is believed to be both an Efficiency of Use and an Error Prevention issue. It could be solved by putting utensils and tools into the ingredient matching selection.
