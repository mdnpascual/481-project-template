# P1: User Research

## Project Idea

We have decided to create a Cooking Instructor as our project. Such a description is very vague and open, so we decided that we would create an app that provides easy-to-follow step-by-step recipes. To differentiate the app from an electronic cookbook, the app will provide other features such as in-app timers for cooking or mixing, voice-overs for the instructions, and illustrations of steps.

We expect this system to be used by people in households with low-to-moderate skill in cooking, yet have interest in developing their cooking skills or simply wish to not rely on ready-made food. The expected context will be that this app will be used before meal-times to cook for personal reasons, although it is also possible the users may cook for company.

## Stakeholders and Users

Stakeholders include grocery stores who would carry the necessary ingredients, food companies & advertisers who may provide their specific brands as ingredients for app revenue, and home-economics teachers who would use this as an easy teaching method using the demonstration videos.

Users are mainly people with low-to-moderate cooking skills of all ages. They would include focus groups such as vegetarians & people on strict-diets, who would make use of the category system. Other focus groups would include people on a budget, students, and single parents, all of whom could make use of the feature that provides alternative ingredients.

## User Research Methods

As our group is smaller than most groups, we only used two user research methods. The first research method is interviews. This method was used because it allows us to find out the thought processes and desires of potential users, which would be good for our app's development.

### User Research Method 1: Interview

For our interview portion, we asked a number of users a series of 5 questions:
1)	What could an Electronic device provide you that a cookbook couldn't?
2)	What difficulties are you having when cooking meals?
3)  Would you try out an electronic cooking instructor?
4)  Are you more likely to try out cooking new things knowing that you have an electronic cooking instructor?
5)  Are you willing to spend money for this kind of app?

_summary of findings_ 

Through interviews, we learned many important things we may have overlooked. For one, we have learned that there are many more options users would want from a cooking instructor that a cook book couldn't give them, such as a visual sense of how ingredients are added, put together and assembled. Also desired are an in-app timer, voice-reading of the steps, and the ability to ask questions and clarify certain steps and concepts. We also learned that users may have concerns with adding ingredients at the wrong time or using the wrong measurement. Most importantly, however, we learned that younger potential users, such as college students or teenagers, are less likely to pay for an app due to recipes being available on the internet and their own lack of funds. But we also confirmed that an electronic cooking instructor would likely make people more adventurous in the sorts of meals they cook.

Bonus things that users said they would desire outside of the interview questions: easy and innovative ways to use leftovers; recipes with 5 or less ingredients; cheaper or vegetarian dishes; and food similar to that in certain restaurants.

### User Research Method 2: Secondary Research

Listing some of these applications that have been researched were: Cook Smarts, PepperPlate, Paprika, Plan to Eat.

_summary of findings_

To see how these apps work and their features. I have tried all of them except with Paprika which ask for a one-time fee purchase for the application. The subscription based ones have free trials which I have utilized.

1)	Looking at the similar cooking helper apps listed above, we have found that most of the popular and successful ones are mostly about planning and organizing meals. 
2)	Across all applications, they all have the feature to create a shopping list, planning the meals on a calendar and displaying the recipes.
3)	Most of the applications are either paid or subscription based, only 1 of out of the 4 was completely free.
4)	Subscription based apps offer weekly meal plans as well as healthier food suggestions compared to the free and one time purchase app.
5)	The use of video guides are not prevalent, the apps only show photos of the ingredients or the finished dish since some of them are based on blogs (some apps has features to scrape a website to get a recipe).
6)	The recipes in the apps doesn’t offer alternative ingredients. Some are basically viewing a regular webpage of a recipe
7)	The apps assumes that you already know a huge set of cooking terms (Ex: Julienne, Batonnet knife cuts)


### Reflections on User Research

I would say that choosing a secondary research as a method of research is a great way to compare what other apps have done to differentiate themselves, and also features that are popular and useful across all of them. While we haven’t found an identical app to what we are planning, having a set of features from similar apps to choose from is a great way for us to base our cooking instructor app. Having the opportunity to see the interfaces of different apps also gives us a better understanding what seems to work well for a particular platform or design.

An issue that may arise from depending too much only on secondary research is we may copy a similar product too much without considering the needs of our potential users that is why we also chose to use the Interview method.

The Interview method worked fairly well in learning what potential users would desire from a cooking app, and even provided us with knowledge of issues we hadn't considered. However, there was still an issue with the selection of people interviewed - we only interviewed a handful, and they did not cover a large demographic. In the future, we would likely need to interview more people with a wider background.

## Task Descriptions

The following are task descriptions describing various possible users who may use the app in the future.

Pete is a 40 year old bachelor who is just learning to cook. He has completed the first step of the recipe for preparing spaghetti and meatballs, and needs to find out where to go next.

Kelly is a 20 year old single vegetarian college student who has experience with cooking for herself, but is not very adventurous. Her college life constantly keeps her on a budget, and she finds it difficult to figure out what the recipes she finds mean unless it’s a video recipe. She doesn’t understand the step in how to mix in the tomato sauce when making vegetarian chili, and needs clarification.

Jack is a 16 year old teen who has enough work ethic and motivation to cook for himself, but not enough to make certain ingredients from scratch. He would like to make a pepperoni pizza for himself that is entirely from store-bought items and requires no preparation of the dough.

Eduardo is a 42 year old father who has recently emigrated from Spain. He is fairly experienced with cooking for his family, but is English second-language and still has difficulties with understanding some terminologies or euphemisms. His cooking knowledge is limited to dishes of his home nationality, and he wishes to branch out and learn more.

Lorraine is a 50 year old housewife who is highly experienced in cooking. She cooks for her family and company all the time. She rarely cooks desserts, however, and wants to learn to bake a cake for her next house party. However, she also has a habit of not checking her ingredient supplies until very late, and often resorts to using alternatives.

Billy is a 14 year old student who wants to cook something special for his parents’ anniversary. He has virtually no cooking experience, however, and does not even know the names of most dishes. He does know what ingredients are available, however, and wants to know what he can cook from them.
