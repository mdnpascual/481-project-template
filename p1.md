# P1: User Research

## Project Idea

_a succinct description of your project idea, how you expect your system to be used, by whom, and the context under which you expect it to be used_ 
We have decided to create a Cooking Instructor as our project. Such a description is very vague and open, so we decided that we would create an app that provides easy-to-follow step-by-step recipes. To differentiate the app from an electronic cookbook, the app will provide other features such as in-app timers for cooking or mixing, voice-overs for the instructions, and illustrations of steps.

We expect this system to be used by people in households with low-to-moderate skill in cooking, yet have interest in developing their cooking skills or simply wish to not rely on ready-made food. The expected context will be that this app will be used before meal-times to cook for personal reasons, although it is also possible the users may cook for company.

## Stakeholders and Users

_provide a list of stakeholders, and describe them as they relate to the design of the system_

Stakeholders include grocery stores who would carry the necessary ingredients, food companies & advertisers who may provide their specific brands as ingredients for app revenue, and home-economics teachers who would use this as an easy teaching method using the demonstration videos.

Users are mainly people with low-to-moderate cooking skills of all ages. They would include focus groups such as vegetarians & people on strict-diets, who would make use of the category system. Other focus groups would include people on a budget, students, and single parents, all of whom could make use of the feature that provides alternative ingredients.

## User Research Methods

_discuss the user research methods you used, provide justification for them_ 

As our group is smaller than most groups, we only used two user research methods. The first research method is interviews. This method was used because it allows us to find out the thought processes and desires of potential users, which would be good for our app's development.

### User Research Method 1: Interview

For our interview portion, we asked a number of users a series of 5 questions:
1)	What could an Electronic device provide you that a cookbook couldn't?
2)	What difficulties are you having when cooking meals?
3)  Would you try out an electronic cooking instructor?
4)  Are you more likely to try out cooking new things knowing that you have an electronic cooking instructor?
5)  Are you willing to spend money for this kind of app?

_summary of findings_ 

Through interviews, we learned many important things we may have overlooked. For one, we have learned that there are many more options users would want from a cooking instructor that a cook book couldn't give them, such as a visual sense of how ingredients are added, put together and assembled. Also desired are an in-app timer, voice-reading of the steps, and the ability to ask questions and clarify certain steps and concepts. We also learned that users may have concerns with adding ingredients at the wrong time or using the wrong measurement. Most importantly, however, we learned that younger potential users, such as college students or teenagers, are less likely to pay for an app due to recipes being available on the internet and their own lack of funds. But we also confirmed that an electronic cooking instructor would likely make people more adventurous in the sorts of meals they cook.

Bonus things that users said they would desire outside of the interview questions: easy and innovative ways to use leftovers; recipes with 5 or less ingredients; cheaper or vegetarian dishes; and food similar to that in certain restaurants.
